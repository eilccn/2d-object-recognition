# Project 3: Real-time Object 2-D Recognition

## Instructions for running executables:

1. Place all .cpp and .h files along with a CMakeLists.txt file into a directory (i.e. called "project3")
2. Open "project3" in Visual Studio Code
3. Build "project3" using the "CMake Tools" extension
4. Run the program by first entering "./project3" followed by the path to the csv file 
5. Note: Every time you need to rebuild the program, the csv file needs to be manually deleted and recreated for it to build correctly.
